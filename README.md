# Austin Animal Shelter EDA
- Analyzed about 120k plus rows of data.
- Found very insightful using visual plots.
- Used pandas,numpy for analyzing the dataset.
- Using matplotlib, seaborn for graphical plots explored how the shelter is performing using univariate and bivariate analysis.
- Used numerical, categorical as well as datetime features for in-depth analysis of animal shelter.

> This is my first EDA project, had soo much fun doing this.
